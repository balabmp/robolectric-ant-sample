# An Android app should always target the latest SDK that is available.
# Robolectric currently only supports 18 or below. Setting the 'emulateSdk'
# configuration option to 18 allows us to run unit tests against apps that
# target 19 or higher.
# See http://robolectric.org/javadoc/org/robolectric/annotation/Config.html#emulateSdk()
